# My Cards For Trello - Chrome Extension

This extension provides you quick access to all your cards in [Trello collaboration tool](https://trello.com/).
Cards are grouped by boards and sorted by last activity in card.

Several types of cards are displayed:

  * cards assigned to me
  * cards commented by me
  * cards where I am mentioned

This extension was inspired by [Trello Cards extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ofhppploglffgmbgmidejclkaipbjpac?hl=cs),
extended by card types, filtering, sorting, due dates.

# Warning
